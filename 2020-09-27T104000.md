## Preambles

Org-roam is designed with the Zettelkasten method in its core philosophy. It turns note-taking into a process of thinking. With the method, thinking becomes a process of linking your units of thoughts (i.e. notes), and incrementally developing the notes and linkages among them. Org-roam is a tool for long-term thinking. It helps you capture your fleeting ideas, and incrementally transform them into well-developed thoughts by finding, linking, and tinkering with them.
